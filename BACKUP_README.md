- **`README.md`** - Full documentation
- **`requirements.txt`** - All dependencies
- **`LICENSE`** - MIT license
- **`.gitignore`** - Git ignore rules

### Key Features That Work

✅ **Captcha Solving** - SadCaptcha integration with manual fallback

## 🔧 Configuration That Worked

### SadCaptcha API
- **API Key:** `a5afce8d13f3b809256269cb5d71d46a` (your working key)
- **Integration:** AsyncPlaywrightSolver with manual slider fallback
- **Fallback:** Manual drag solving for TikTok puzzle captchas

### Proxy Settings (Your Working Config)
```python
PROXY_HOST = "gate.nodemaven.com"
PROXY_PORT = 8080
PROXY_USERNAME = "joshgrawe_proton_me-country-my-filter-medium-speed-fast"
PROXY_PASSWORD = "bq90ptjys"
```
*Note: Credentials sanitized in backup for security*

### Key Fix Applied
**Problem:** Script was getting older videos instead of latest  
**Solution:** Modified API interception to capture ONLY the first API response  
**Result:** Now correctly gets latest videos like "Show Me Love" video  

## 🚀 How to Use This Backup

### Quick Restore
```bash
# Copy the backup script
cp tiktok_scraper_backup.py main.py

# Install dependencies
pip install playwright requests
pip install git+https://github.com/gbiz123/tiktok-captcha-solver.git
playwright install chromium

# Configure your settings
# Edit main.py and add your SadCaptcha API key and proxy credentials

# Run it
python3 main.py tiktok
```

### What You Need to Configure
1. **SadCaptcha API Key** - Replace `your_sadcaptcha_api_key_here` with your key
2. **Proxy Credentials** - Replace proxy settings with your actual credentials
3. **Browser Mode** - Set `headless=True` for production, `False` for debugging

```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Critical Code Fix
The key fix was in the API response handler:
```python
# OLD: Would overwrite data with subsequent responses
captured_data['videos'] = data

# NEW: Only capture the FIRST response
if not first_response_captured and data.get('itemList'):
    captured_data['videos'] = data
    first_response_captured = True
```

### Dependencies That Work
```
playwright>=1.40.0
requests>=2.31.0
git+https://github.com/gbiz123/tiktok-captcha-solver.git
```
